# Security Camera Design Project - Designed with SOLIDWORKS

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and development of an inexpensive network-connected security camera. The project is divided into three main tasks:

1. **Task 1: Concept Sketches**
   - Create orthographic and isometric sketches of the security camera design.
  
2. **Task 2: CAD Models**
   - Develop CAD models of individual components and an assembly using SOLIDWORKS.

3. **Task 3: Working Drawings & Complete Project**
   - Compile working drawings and a zipped archive of all CAD files.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Concept Sketches


1. **Orthographic Sketch**: 
   - Draw a front view of the complete assembly.
   - Use unruled paper and follow orthographic drawing conventions.
   - Include authorâ€™s name, student number, and date.
  
2. **Isometric Sketch**: 
   - Draw the complete assembly in isometric view.
   - Ensure the isometric axis is laid out correctly.
   - Use unruled paper and adhere to isometric drawing conventions.
  
### Task 2: CAD Models

- **SOLIDWORKS Modeling**:
  - Create individual part models for each component of the security camera design.
  - Estimate the total weight of the casing and ensure it meets the design requirement of less than 150 g.
  - Generate isometric view drawings of each part, labeling components clearly.
  - Assemble all designed parts and the provided components into a single assembly model in SOLIDWORKS.
  - Create a SOLIDWORKS drawing of the assembly with a note indicating the calculated casing weight.

### Task 3: Working Drawings & Complete Project

- **Final Deliverables**:
  - Include a zip file containing all SOLIDWORKS parts and assemblies.
  - Prepare a comprehensive report in a single PDF format that includes:
    1. A pictorial view of the design.
    3. **Working Drawings**: Detailed drawings of all parts with necessary dimensions, tolerances, and title blocks.
    4. **Pictorial Views**: Isometric and partial views of the complete assembly.
    5. **Assembly Drawing**: An exploded view with a Bill of Materials (BOM) specifying material for each part.

## Design Requirements

- The external casing must include a tilting stand that supports the provided PCB and camera sensor-lens assembly.
- The casing and stand should be manufacturable by injection molding using ABS thermoplastic, with a total weight of under 150 g.
- The design must ensure access to the external power supply and Ethernet jack.
- Incorporate a raised text label for the company name (initials of group members) and model ID (last two digits of student numbers).


## Repository Contents

- **Images**: Folder containing various views of the design.
- **SOLIDWORKS Files**: Zip file with all part files and the assembly file for the complete security camera.
